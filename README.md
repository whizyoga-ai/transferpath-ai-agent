# TransferPath AI: College Transfer & Credit Maximizer

## Overview

TransferPath AI is an intelligent transfer credit optimization platform that helps community college students maximize credit transfer, save money, and accelerate degree completion. By leveraging AI agents to analyze articulation agreements, predict credit equivalencies, and optimize transfer pathways, TransferPath AI solves the costly problem of lost credits during college transfers.

## The Problem

Community college students transferring to 4-year institutions face significant challenges:

- **13 credits lost on average** per transfer (Government Accountability Office, 2023)
- **$39,000+ in wasted tuition** and delayed graduation costs
- **Complex articulation agreements** across 1,100+ community colleges and 2,000+ 4-year institutions
- **Opaque credit transfer policies** that vary by institution, major, and even course year
- **Manual course planning** requiring hours of research across multiple websites

## Solution: 4 AI Agents Working in Concert

TransferPath AI deploys four specialized AI agents to optimize the transfer process:

### 1. **Articulation Agreement Mapper**
Automatically analyzes and maps transfer pathways between specific community colleges and 4-year institutions
- Parses institutional articulation agreements
- Identifies guaranteed transfer pathways
- Tracks agreement updates and changes
- Maps course-to-course equivalencies

### 2. **Credit Equivalency Agent**
Predicts how courses will transfer and identifies credit-maximizing course selections
- Machine learning models trained on historical transfer data
- Predicts "fuzzy" transfers where official agreements don't exist
- Recommends course sequences that maximize credit acceptance
- Flags courses likely to be rejected

### 3. **Cost Optimization Agent**
Models total degree cost across different transfer pathways and timing strategies
- Calculates total degree cost (community college + university)
- Compares 2+2 vs 1+3 vs direct enrollment pathways
- Factors in financial aid, scholarships, and residency
- Optimizes for fastest/cheapest degree completion

### 4. **Application Synchronizer Agent**
Coordinates application materials and deadlines across multiple institutions
- Tracks application deadlines and requirements
- Manages transcript requests and submissions
- Monitors application status across institutions
- Sends deadline reminders and action items

## Market Opportunity

- **2.1 million students** transfer from community colleges annually (National Student Clearinghouse)
- **$82 billion lost** to credit non-transfer and extended time-to-degree
- **1,100+ community colleges** and **2,000+ 4-year institutions** in the US
- **Growing transfer pathways** as states implement guaranteed transfer programs

## Technology Stack

- **AI Framework:** GPT-4 / LangChain multi-agent orchestration
- **Data Sources:** Institutional APIs, articulation agreement databases, course catalogs
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with course catalog and transfer data
- **Frontend:** React.js web application
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI
- **Hosting:** AWS (EC2, RDS, S3)

## Business Model

### B2C (Direct to Students)
- **$49 per transfer evaluation** (one-time fee)
- Comprehensive transfer credit analysis
- Personalized course recommendations
- Application timeline management

### B2B (Institutional Licensing)
- **Community college site licenses** ($5,000-15,000/year)
